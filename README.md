Netflix Main Website Page

---

In this project, I recreate the Netflix's main website page using HTML5 Css3, and javascript.
Some features are added to the project, such as font-awesome icons and CSS3 variables.

---

The purpose of the project is to go back to the basics of HTML5 and CSS3 by using flexbox and CSS grid.
